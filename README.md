# Crop-Optimizer-Efficient-Data-Driven-Solutions

### Overview
Crop Optimizer is an innovative data-driven framework designed to enhance agricultural productivity by leveraging **Geographic Information System (GIS)** technology and real-time **meteorological** data. The system provides intelligent crop recommendations based on **soil** and **weather** conditions in an area, helping farmers make informed decisions for optimal yield. It is trained on the long-short term memory (LSTM) model.
The project achieved a significant improvement in prediction accuracy from 35% to about 75% through the integration of GIS and weather API insights, demonstrating its potential to increase crop yields by up to 30%.
